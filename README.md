# Price/Performance Scraper
Price/Performance Scraper is a full-stack web application that can scrape online price listings of GPU and CPU models in real-time, compare the prices to up-to-date performance benchmarks of said models, and then finally rank every listed product found by its **Price/Performance Score**. It is designed to make it really easy for a user to find out which product has the best value for money, and where to buy it.

***As of now, only online stores in Sweden are available for scraping.***

## Demo Deployment

The application is currently deployed. However, since the project started, it has become impossible to perform price scraping if the back-end is hosted at a data center. Without either self-hosting the back-end from a residential IP-address, or using a residential proxy service, it is no longer possible to perform real-time price scrapes using the website.

Everything else on both the front-end and back-end still works. **In the Demo Deployment, real-time Price Scraping is mocked.** When a Price Scrape is started, instead of performing a Price Scrape, the back-end will just wait for a few seconds, and then return a random completed Price Scrape of the same Benchmark Type from the database.

The back-end still works like it should when you run it on localhost. If you want to set up the application on your localhost, follow the guide in the **[Set Up Application On Localhost](#set-up-application-on-localhost)** section.

## About The Application

The application consists of a back-end made in **Python** and **Django**, with a **PostgreSQL** database, and a front-end made with **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js 13** and **PicoCSS**. **Docker** is also being used to host the back-end in development.

The front-end is a website where the user can select which GPU or CPU models they want to compare. With just the click of a button, Python will start web-scraping on the back-end. Once the scrape is finished and the Price/Performance Scores calculated on the back-end, the user is presented with a table consisting of all product listings found, ranked by their Price/Performance Scores. The user is able to interact with the table, like filter out specific stores or products, or just sort the table by a different column.

All completed price scrapes are viewable from the website, and thanks to Next.js' **Static Site Generation**, each completed scrape page will load incredibly quickly.

### Things To Note
*A global **3 minute cooldown** is placed on price scraping. This means that only one person can start a price scrape every three minutes.*

*When scraping **GPU** models, only the 5 to 8 cheapest sub-models for every GPU model will get scraped.*

## Price/Performance Score
The Price/Performance Score given to every scraped product listing is calculated like this: <br>
**( Benchmark Value รท Price ) ร 100**

**A higher Price/Performance Score indicates better value for money.** However, it does **not** indicate better performance, as flagship models usually has worse Price/Performance Score than their cheaper counterparts. It is up to the consumer to decide which they value more.

Also note that **GPU** models always come in various sub-models, made by third-party manufacturers. These sub-models often have differing performance benchmarks. This application does not have access to performance benchmark data of individual GPU sub-models, and can thus not differentiate between them.

The website does feature a **Manual Comparison Tool**, partly to deal with this problem. This tool allows the user to manually enter price and performance values for multiple products, in order to compare Price/Performance Scores.
## Benchmarks

There are three different types of benchmark values in this app; **GPU Performance**, **CPU (Gaming Performance)** and **CPU (Multi-threaded Performance)**. Benchmark values are automatically scraped and updated once every day. CPU benchmarks are sourced from PassMark and GPU benchmarks are an aggregate of data from PassMark and Tom's Hardware.

The current benchmark values in use are displayed on the website.

Benchmark Values range from **100.00** to **0.01**, where the highest performing model in the list will always have a Benchmark Value of 100.00. The values are linear, which means that a product with a Benchmark Value of 50.00 has half the performance of the best product in the same category.

Products are sorted into **Benchmark Tiers** based on having similar performance levels. This makes it easier to find products of comparable performance.

### Benchmark Disclaimers
Benchmark values are not always accurate and in no way definite.

CPU Gaming benchmark values are semi-theoretical and not based on performance benchmarks from actual games. Thus, they should be taken with a grain of salt.

No comparisons are made between individual third-party sub-models when it comes to GPU Benchmarks.
## Manual Comparison Tool
The Manual Comparison Tool on the website can be used to calculate Price/Performance Scores using custom prices and/or benchmark values instead of the prices and benchmark values scraped by the app. Keep in mind that these scores will not match the Price/Performance Scores generated by scrapes unless the benchmark values are constructed using the same formula shown in the 'Price/Performance Score' section.

## Included Models
This section lists which CPU and GPU models are available in this app. **Unavailable models are not available for price scraping, nor are their benchmark data collected.**

### Available GPU Models
*Many GPUs from the previous two generations are not included, mainly due to their retail prices often being higher than current generation GPUs, despite having worse benchmark scores. Since this will always result in a terrible Price/Performance Score, the models are simply not available.*

***Intel GPUs** also has terrible Price/Performance Scores no matter what, and are thus not included.*
